## Versioning Scheme

This project follows **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Version numbers increase according to the following principles:  
- **MAJOR** versions for significant changes that may break backward compatibility.  
- **MINOR** versions for backward‑compatible functionality additions or improvements.  
- **PATCH** versions for backward‑compatible bug fixes or documentation updates.  

All changes are recorded in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file, which uses the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format. Release notes are automatically generated via a GitHub Actions workflow that runs when a version tag is pushed and uses GitHub's `generate_release_notes` feature.  

The initial version of this repository is **v0.1.0**, released on January 19, 2026, which introduces the versioning plan, adds the changelog, documents this scheme, and sets up the automated release workflow.
